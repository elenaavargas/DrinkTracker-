Water Tracker
Water Tracker is a simple and intuitive application designed to help users monitor their daily water intake. The app provides a clear visual representation of the progress toward an easy-to-use interface.
Features
The main feature you can see in the screen, displays a water tank-style graphic that fills up proportionally based on the amount of water consumed. 
Native Components
The "Drink water" button allows users to log a predefined amount of water. The water level visual updates instantly with smooth animations. A reset button is available to clear the daily total and start fresh at any time.
All the components are Native.
All the other features are just aesthetic, for now.
